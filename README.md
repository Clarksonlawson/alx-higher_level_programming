# Python, Shell, and C Programming Project

## Overview

This repository contains Python, Shell, and C scripts as part of a project aimed at mastering programming concepts and practices. The learning objectives of this project include understanding the awesomeness of Python programming, recognizing the creator of Python (Guido van Rossum), exploring the Zen of Python, and gaining familiarity with coding style and best practices.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, I, Clarkson Awomu, am expected to be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- Who created Python (Guido van Rossum)
- The origin of the name ‘Python’
- What the Zen of Python is
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using `print`
- Basics of working with strings
- Concepts of indexing and slicing in Python
- The official Python coding style and using `pycodestyle` for code checking

## File Structure
